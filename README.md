# The source code of my website

The live version could be found at https://www.idevele.com

Some not too interesting tidbits:

- I have now ditched Bootstrap in favor of Flex, which makes the site much lighter (and probably not compatible with older and/or bizarre browsers too - sorry IE9, Safari and Opera 12 users)
- Used Inkscape for the vector graphics and accordingly, ditched all the PNGs in favor of SVGs
- The SVG animations are "handmade" (which means the timing and all that crap is done by trial&error), and had to use a stupid "duplicate inline svg paths" trick to animate dashed lines)
- Uses mostly jQuery for the DOM manipulation (might as well ditch it in favor of vanilla JS/ES6 once I find the time)
- I have found the viewport check code laying in my code-snippets folder, so only God knows who made it
- The remarkably sophisticated random bubbling "effect" in the header was made by me
- The extraordinarily exciting "design" was made also by me
- So far, only tested Chrome and Firefox (Linux/Debian versions) and Edge
- Used VSC for putting the code together
